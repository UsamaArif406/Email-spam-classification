# Email Spam Classification Project

## Overview

The Email Spam Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the email text data and applies machine learning algorithms to build the classification model. The project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook (`email-spam-classification.ipynb`) and a PDF report (`email-spam-classification.pdf`).

## Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and selection
- Saving the final model for deployment

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
